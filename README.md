# Project-One
// BASIC GAME PLAY
	// Simon Says is a game where the player must remember the pattern in which colors appear on the screen and repeat the pattern back to the computer
		// Usually played with four colors, red, green, yellow, blue
		// Colors flash one by one, starting with 4 colors
		// Flash patterns are random, same color can flash more than once
		// Player must repeat the same pattern by clicking on the colors in the order they flashed
		// If the player guesses the wrong sequence, they lose a point
		// If the player guesses the correct sequence, they move on to the next level, which is slightly harder than the level before
		// Game is over when the player is out of points
		// Player will start with 5-10 points or "lives" (will decide if I need to raise the count if the game is too easy)
